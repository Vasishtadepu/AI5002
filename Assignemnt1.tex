\section*{Problem 1.7}
It is known that 10$\%$ of certain articles manufactured are defective. What is the probability that in a random sample of 12 such articles, 9 are defective?
\section*{Solution 1.7}
The repeated selections of articles in a random sample space are Bernoulli trials. Let $X$ denote the number of times of selecting defective articles in a random sample space of 12 articles.\\

Clearly $X$, has a binomial distribution with n=12 and p=10\%=$\frac{1}{10}$=0.1
and q=1-p=1-$\frac{1}{10}$=$\frac{9}{10}$\\

$$\therefore X = B (n,p)$$

The probability mass function(p.m.f) for a general binomial distribution is given by $$P[X=x]= {n \choose x} \times p^x\times q^{n-x}$$

In this case n=12 , p=$\frac{1}{10}$ and q=$\frac{9}{10}$, So 
$$p(x)={12 \choose x}\times(\frac{1}{10})^x\times(\frac{9}{10})^{12-x}$$
where $p(x)$ is the probability of getting $x$ number of defective articles and $x\in \{0,1,2.......12\}$\\

In this case we want $p(9)$ $$p(9)={12 \choose 9}\times(\frac{1}{10})^9\times(\frac{9}{10})^{3}$$
$$=\frac{12!}{9!3!}\times\frac{1}{10^9}\times\frac{9^3}{10^3}$$

$$=\frac{12\times11\times10}{3\times2\times1}\times\frac{729}{10^12}$$
$$=\frac{16038}{10^{11}}$$
So, the probability of there being 9 defective articles in a random sample space of 12 articles is $p(9)=1.6038x10^{-7}$ 


\section*{Python code}
Since the probability of producing 9 defective articles is very very low we need to run a large simulation. But a large simulation takes a large amount of time which is inefficient so we need to strike a balance between time and the precision to the original value. So a simulation of $4\times10^8$ would likely yield a better results in a better time\\
